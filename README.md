- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bjohnson66
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a computer science and engineering major at the UNiversity of Iowa. I have experience with Python, C++, nad the Processing Javascript Library
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... bjohnson66@uiowa.edu

Much of my Python code I am most proud of is for assignments, so, not wanting to aid or commit acedemic misconduct, I have not added them to any public repository.
